* **Objective**: Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: https://fcc-voting-arthow4n.herokuapp.com/ and deploy it to Heroku.
* **User Story**: As an authenticated user, I can keep my polls and come back later to access them.
* **User Story**: As an authenticated user, I can share my polls with my friends.
* **User Story**: As an authenticated user, I can see the aggregate results of my polls.
* **User Story**: As an authenticated user, I can delete polls that I decide I don't want anymore.
* **User Story**: As an authenticated user, I can create a poll with any number of possible items.
* **User Story**: As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see and vote on everyone's polls.
* **User Story**: As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see the results of polls in chart form. (This could be implemented using Chart.js or Google Charts.)
* **User Story**: As an authenticated user, if I don't like the options on a poll, I can create a new option.
